New C++ functions
==================


Writing a new producer consists of two parts. First, the C++ function to act on the ROOT Dataframe has to be created. In principle, the interface of the function is completely arbitrary, but a few things should be remembered, to make the new producer align with the design of the existing ones.

* The producer should live in a well defined namespace. If a producer is meant for electrons only, if should be contained in an electron namespace, rather than putting electron in the function name.

* The dataframe object that is meant to be modified by the function :code:`(auto df,)` should always be the first argument.

* The function must always return a new dataframe object and nothing else.

* If possible, use only references for the function arguments (--> faster).

A generic new skeleton for a function looks like this:

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto GenericFunction(auto df, const std::string& parameter_1, const std::string& parameter_2,
           const float value_1) {
        auto df1 = df.Define(....);
        return df1;
    }
